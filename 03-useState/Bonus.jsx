/*
    1. Create a new Vite React Project

    2. Create a Counter2.jsx file to create a Counter2
       Component that you export within it

    3. Inside Counter2, create an <h1> with a <button>
       element with the '+' text inside it.

    4. Make it so that the <h1> displays a counter starting at
       0 and when you click the button, it goes up by 2. However,
       you can only use ONE event handler function to do this and 
       must use TWO calls to the setState function where each 
       makes the count go up by 1. (You can't just use one setState
       to make it go up by 2 immediately)

    5. Import the Counter component in to main.jsx and replace the
       <App /> with it and test that it works in the Browser

   HINT* There is an alternative signature for the setState functions

   BONUS* WHY does it work this way?
   BONUS2* Can you use this to refactor exercise 3 slightly? (passing
           only the setState function, not the state itself)

import React, { useState } from "react";

const Bonus = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  const handleCounter = () => {
    setCounter((prev) => prev + 1);
    setCounter((prev) => prev + 1);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      Bonus
      <h2>counter value:{counter}</h2>
      <button onClick={handleCounter}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Bonus;
